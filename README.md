# MyAutomationProject

Here you can find some test examples for https://demoblaze.com/ which is an e-commerce website.

I have worked with MAVEN as a build management tool.

I used Sselenium with Junit as a testing tool with CUCUMBER BDD framework based on Page Object Model.

In addition, I have also worked on the same cases with TestNG and Data Driven Testing using Apache POI in the TestNGTests folder.
